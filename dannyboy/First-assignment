What is the difference between a driver controller and device driver?

A device driver is a small piece of software that tells the operating system and other software how to communicate with a piece of hardware.

 Device controller is a hardware unit attached to the I/O bus of the computer and works like an interface between a device and a device driver. It is an electronic component consisting of chips that is responsible for handling the incoming and outgoing signals of the CPU.
