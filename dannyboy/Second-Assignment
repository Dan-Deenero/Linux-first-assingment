LINUX FILESYSTEM HIERARCHY STANDARDS
Linux doesn't use seperate drive letters, like windows. Insteaatd, all drives are organised under one directory structure starting at /slash)
1. BIN-This stores important executable programs
2. BOOT-This contains all the files needed to boot the system such as linux kernel 
3. DEV- This aren't really files but physical devices. Contains static files for the boot loader.  This directory holds only the files which are needed during the  boot  process. The map  installer  and  configuration  files should go to /sbin and /etc.  The operating system kernel (initrd for example) must be located in either / or /boot.
